Along with the codes it has been provided a large dataset of precomputed meshes in the folder *utils/sz_slabs*. These meshes has been computed either from the geometrical modelling provided by the project Slab 2.0 (see available geometry at the web-page https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5aa1b00ee4b0b1c392e86467) or from the modelling proposed by the Geoscience Australia (available at: *https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ptha*). The Mediterranean slab models are the same used in the framework of TSUMAPS-NEAM project (see *http://www.tsumaps-neam.eu/*, see also Maesano et al. 2017, Basili et al. 2021)
